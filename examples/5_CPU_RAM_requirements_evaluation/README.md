# PEWO demo nÂ°5

## Overview

This demo measures CPU/RAM/TIME resources consumed by the different
placement softwares, using a reference dataset of 16S-rRNA barcodes.

EPA-ng, PPlacer, RAPPAS are tested.
Each measure is repeated 2 times.
This analysis will require around 3 hours of computation.

Final measures are reported as the mean of the repeats.
Consequently, increasing repeats would produce better evaluations.

## How to launch

Download pipeline.
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/phylo42/PEWO.git
cd PEWO
```

Execute installation script.
```
chmod u+x INSTALL.sh
./INSTALL.sh
```

After installation, load environement.
```
conda activate PEWO
```

Test workflow before launch.
```
snakemake -np \
--snakefile eval_resources.smk \
--config workdir=$(pwd)/examples/5_CPU_RAM_requirements_evaluation/run \
query_user=`pwd`/examples/5_CPU_RAM_requirements_evaluation/EMP_92_studies_100000.fas \
--configfile examples/5_CPU_RAM_requirements_evaluation/config.yaml
```

Execute workflow, using 2 CPU cores and 16Gb of RAM.
```
snakemake -p --cores 2 --resources mem_mb=16000 \
--snakefile eval_resources.smk \
--config workdir=$(pwd)/examples/5_CPU_RAM_requirements_evaluation/run \
query_user=`pwd`/examples/5_CPU_RAM_requirements_evaluation/EMP_92_studies_100000.fas \
--configfile examples/5_CPU_RAM_requirements_evaluation/config.yaml
```

## Comments

In this example, 'workdir' and 'query_user' config flags are set
dynamically, as it is required they are passed as absolute paths.
You could also set them manually by editing the config.yaml file
before launch.
